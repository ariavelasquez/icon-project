      <p>It's no secret that New York City has seen a spike in gun violence this year. Shootings across all five boroughs are up year-over-year with devastating consequences. One solution authorities have used to try to decrease the number of
        firearms on the streets is gun buybacks.</p>
      <p class="reminder">⚠️ Important Note: While shootings in NYC are up year-over-year, virtually every corner of the city is down from 10-year highs and all-time highs in the 90s.</p>
