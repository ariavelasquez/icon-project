    </header>

    <div class="flexbox1">

      <p>It's no secret that New York City has seen a spike in gun violence this year. Shootings across all five boroughs are up year-over-year with devastating consequences. One solution authorities have used to try to decrease the number of
        firearms on the streets is gun buybacks.</p>
      <p class="reminder">⚠️ Important Note: While shootings in NYC are up year-over-year, virtually every corner of the city is down from 10-year highs and all-time highs in the 90s.</p>

          <p class="subhead"> The event begins and people show up with their firearms in a paper bag, a plastic bin, or a locked box. The gun(s) must be in an opaque container. If the person is arriving by car, the gun should be locked in the trunk
            until they reach the buyback location.</p>
